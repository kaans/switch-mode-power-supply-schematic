= Switch mode power supply with TI LMR50410

This switch mode power supply is a very small design
to convert (lead) battery voltages between 9 to 30 Volts
down to stable 3.3 Volts. It supports a current of up to
1A.

Find the schematic online at
https://aisler.net/p/PBSTXYMH[https://aisler.net/p/PBSTXYMH]. You can also import it to your
aisler sandbox and order it yourself.

The board has a BOM of only 11 parts (apart from the
pin headers). It also has a red LED that shows whether the 3.3 Volt output is turned on. It can be soldered
onto the board or left of, as desired.

The enable output is accessible through a jumper and can be connected to an external enable input, if required. For an always on setup, just connect the
pin header JP1 with a jumper. This pulls the enable pin to Vin and keeps the circuit switched on.

The board can be soldered by hand. The smallest parts are 0603 and the SOT-23-6 IC.

An example order for soldering the parts is as follows:

`U1, C3, R2, R1, L1, C4, C5, D1, R3, C2, C1, JP1`

Solder the pin headers J1 through J4 according to your needs.

You can also solder screw terminals onto J1 and J2, as well as J3 and J4. Due to the small size the screw terminals don't fit on the top side but on the bottom.

Size: 2,8cm x 1,3cm
